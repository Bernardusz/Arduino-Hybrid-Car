# 🚗 Arduino-Hybrid-Car Project

> **Land + Drone Mode | Powered by Arduino | Made with Passion by 9th Graders**

## 📖 Overview

This is a dual-mode Arduino vehicle that can operate on land **and** transform into a drone. Designed and coded by our team as a legacy project for future students, it showcases a blend of **software creativity**, **hardware innovation**, and **team collaboration**.

## 🎯 Features

* 🛞 **Land Mode** – Line-following, obstacle detection, manual control via Bluetooth.
* 🚁 **Drone Mode** – Flight control via IR/Bluetooth + gesture controls (planned).
* 🔁 **Mode Switch** – Switch seamlessly between land and air modes with a simple command.
* 🧠 **Modular Code** – Clean structure using PlatformIO and C++ for scalability.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

* **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno
* **IDE:** VS Code + PlatformIO
* **Libraries:** Adafruit Motor Shield, Servo, IRremote, etc.
* **Languages:** C++, Arduino (.ino structure)
